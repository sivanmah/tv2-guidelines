    <h2>II. Design and User Experience</h2>
    <h3>A. Avoid Yo-Yo User Journeys</h3>
    <p>Prevent users from frequently navigating in and out of pages. For example, eliminate the need to return to the homepage to access different pages.</p>
    <h3>B. Streamline Content</h3>
    <p>Reevaluate the necessity of your website's pages and content. Less is more for sustainability.</p>
    <h3>C. Dark Mode</h3>
    <p>Implement an automatic dark mode or adopt a dark mode-first approach for OLED screens.</p>

    <h2>III. Content Optimization</h2>
    <h3>A. Images</h3>
    <p>1. File Type: Use WEBP instead of JPEG for 30% smaller file size. Use PNG or GIF for images with few block colors, like icons.</p>
    <p>2. Optimization: Utilize tools like Shortpixel, TinyPNG, or ImageAlpha to reduce image file sizes.</p>
    <p>3. Responsive Images: Employ "srcset" and "sizes" attributes in HTML "picture" elements to display images based on screen size.</p>
    <p>4. Additional Techniques: Implement blurring, CSS monochrome or grayscale, and SVG optimization to further reduce file size.</p>
    <p>5. Image Spacing: Reduce image width and height to decrease file size and enhance impact.</p>
    <h3>B. Typography</h3>
    <p>1. System Fonts: Use pre-installed system fonts to avoid data transfer.</p>
    <p>2. Font Hosting: Host font files on your server instead of using font services to reduce server requests.</p>
    <p>3. Font Files: Remove unneeded files and use variable fonts for multiple font styles. Convert files to WOFF2 format.</p>
    <p>4. Optimization: Use tools like Fontdrop and Everything Fonts to remove unused characters, subject to foundry license terms.</p>

    <h2>IV. Power Consumption</h2>
    <h3>A. Color</h3>
    <p>Dark colors use less power on OLED screens. Optimize color usage with tools like Codepen.</p>
    <h3>B. Video</h3>
    <p>Minimize video usage and autoplay. Opt for images, text, or interactive CSS animations when possible.</p>
    <h3>C. GIFs</h3>
    <p>Replace GIF animations with more efficient WEBP files.</p>
    <h3>D. Animations</h3>
    <p>Limit front-end animations to reduce CPU usage.</p>
